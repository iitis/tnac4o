Welcome to otn2d's documentation!
=================================

**otn2d** is an open-source package to heuristically solve Ising-type optimization problems defined on quasi-2d lattices, including, for instance, the chimera graph.
It employs tensor network contractions to calculate marginal probabilities and identify the most probable states according to Gibbs distribution.
By identifying spin-glass droplets, it allows reconstructing the low-energy spectrum of the model. It can also be used for Random Markov Fields defined on 2d lattice.

**otn2d** is based on the paper M. M. Rams, M. Mohseni and B. Gardas, *"Optimization and discovery of spinâ€“glass droplets with approximate tensor networks contractions"*,
