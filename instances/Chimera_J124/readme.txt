Instances defined on a chimera graph with couplings J_ij uniformly distributed in {-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4} and no local fields.

Chimera C=8 has N=512 variables (C=12 has N=1152, and C=16 has N=2048). We include 200 instances for each system size, and collect our results (ground state energies and ground state degeneracies found) in files results_C*_J124.txt
